<p>We're getting married in the woods of South China Maine, at the summer camp that Justice attended as a child. It's an old rustic Quaker Camp, so come packed for camp!</p>

You might want to bring:
<ul>
	<li>Shoes you can (want to?) run around in</li>
	<li>Bug spray and sunscreen</li>
	<li>Your favorite songbook (Rise Up Singing?)</li>
	<li>A bathing suit</li>
	<li>Your spare canoe (you have one of those, right?)</li>
	<li>A change of comfortable clothing</li>
</ul>
	
<p>And if you're staying over we'll contact you about what you need to bring to sleep in a cabin!</p>

<p>For a map and pictures of the campgrounds, you can take a look at <%= link_to "this page", "http://friendscamp.org/map-of-camp/", target: "_blank" %> on their website. </p>
